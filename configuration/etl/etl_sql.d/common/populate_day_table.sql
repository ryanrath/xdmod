/*
This is probably the easiest of the four queries to explain and all of them work on the same basic principle.
This method of generation uses a Recursive CTE ( https://mariadb.com/kb/en/recursive-common-table-expressions-overview/ )
in this case `days` to dynamically generate records for the `modw.days` table until the `WHERE` clause is no longer
true, in this case when `date` >= "2038-01-18".

It does this by using a standard recursive cte pattern whereby two SELECT statements are `UNION ALL`'d. The base query
executes first, taking whatever it needs to compute the result R0. The second recursive query is executed taking R0 as
input â€” that is R references R0 in the recursive query when first executed. The recursive query produces the result R1,
and that is what R will reference at the next invocation, and so on until a recursive query returns an empty result. At
that point, all intermediate results are combined together.
